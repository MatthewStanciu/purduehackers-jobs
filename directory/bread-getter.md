Help us raise $6,000+ per year to fund our programs.

# About Purdue Hackers

Making creative technical projects is highly rewardingâ€”but academic and social obligations make it hard to find the time & energy to do it regularly. Purdue Hackers aims to help others find their people and make things together regularly.

Please read the `README.md` for more information if you haven't already.

# About the role

Purdue Hackers spends roughly $6,000 per school year. Our largest expense is Hack Night, which we run every Friday & costs $200 per week. This may not seem like a lot, but it adds up: we typically run 12 Hack Nights per semester, or 24 Hack Nights per school year, which at an average cost of $200, costs us $4,800 per year. Some Hack Nights have cost us up to $500, however, and we've funded a few student projects ranging in cost from $100 to $400, which brings our average yearly spend to the range of $6,000.

Even at $6,000 per year, we feel the crunch. Many students want their creative projects funded, but we can't fund most of them without running out of money. At least a few people go without pizza at Hack Night because we can't afford to feed them. Some of the more expensive Hack Nights have been a result of us trying out a new activity once or twice before realizing the cost is unsustainable. And because our existing programs are already crunched, we can't afford to experiment with new initiatives that cost money.

For as long as we've all been students, Purdue Hackers has spent more money than we've raisedâ€”and we're finally starting to run low. Worse, our programs have quadrupled in size over the past year, increasing the cost & crunch. Worse still, we are so bad at raising money: over the past year, Purdue Hackers only raised $1,000 for its general fund.

We are looking for someone to help us close our deficit and double our yearly budget, allowing us to give our existing programs the funds they deserve and explore new & ambitious initiatives.

## What you will do

- Cold email hundreds of sponsors asking them to sponsor Purdue Hackers
- Reach out to past sponsors in our network and ask them to sponsor us again
- Gain warm intros to companies via personal networks
- Apply for grants and/or funding from the Purdue CS department
- End-to-end own our fundraising strategy. Come up with creative ways to get in front of sponsors or otherwise raise money.

_(Note: we already have a cold email template and sponsorship proposal. You are welcome to make edits to them, but you don't have to write new ones.)_

## About you

You will be a great fit for this role if:

- Are radically kind, creative, wholesome, and curious
- Deeply resonate with Purdue Hackers & feel inspired to make it better
- Have raised money for a nonprofit or student org in the past
- Are an excellent & persuasive writer

Please apply if you are interested even if you don't feel like you tick every box!

## Time commitment

Some organizers spend 5-10 hours per week; others spend 20-30 hours per week. Some weeksâ€”particularly earlier in the semesterâ€”will be heavier than others. Some weeks you may have to spend more than 10 hours; other weeks, you can probably spend 5 or fewer hours. We're all full-time students, though, & are happy to be flexible.

# How to apply

## Next steps

We will reply to confirm we've received it; after that, you will only hear from us if we're interested in following up. There's no deadline on either end, and it's possible this position won't be filled for a while.

If we're interested in following up, we'll reach out to schedule a 20-minute Zoom call to get to know each other better.

After the call, you will receive a final follow-up within a week.
