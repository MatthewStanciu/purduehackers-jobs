# Read this before applying

Purdue Hackers is a group of students who help each other build creative technical projects. We're looking for a few new organizers to join our team. Thanks for checking out our little app! :D

Please read this before applying for any of the positions.

## What is Purdue Hackers?

Making creative technical projects is highly rewardingâ€”but academic and social obligations make it hard to find the time & energy to do it regularly. Purdue Hackers aims to help others find their people and make things together regularly.

Purdue Hackers is made up of 3 core programs:

- **Hack Night**: Our flagship program. A hacker festival every Friday night at the Bechtel Center.
- **Workshops**: Hour-long sessions that teach something new; attendees leave with a finished project.
- **Community**: A vibrant, friendly Discord community where people hang out & ship projects. We also announce all our events on there.

Purdue Hackers feels like stepping into a magical, colorful universe, a strange & surreal simulation of the real world. Community members have made a flag, and [an alternative time system](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time), and [passports for the "citizens" of Purdue Hackers](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/papers-please).

Internally, Purdue Hackers operates similarly to a startup: we have projects with directly responsible individuals, deliverables, & deadlines. We view our work as "shipping" to customers.

## Organizers vs. community members

Purdue Hackers is highly community-driven; many community members who are not organizers have run workshops, helped organize Hack Night, and helped others in the community. Our table at the Fall 2023 and Fall 2024 B-Involved fair was manned by two commmunity members. If you're looking to contribute to Purdue Hackers, you don't need to join as an organizer; you can literally just start helping out with stuff. Build infrastructure, help organize Hack Night, run your own workshops, propose your own events, be a positive presence in the community. There's an endless list of stuff to do, and many non-organizer community members are currently making their way through the list.

So, if community members already contribute so much to Purdue Hackers, why are we recruiting organizers?

Community members never commit to doing work; everything they do is done entirely out of personal excitement and/or the goodness of their hearts. The fuel of collective community member excitement can take us far, but we can't run an organization entirely on it. We need to be able to count on there always being someone to ensure the success of workshops, design marketing material for upcoming events, maintain our software infrastructure, and secure funding.

**This is why we have organizers.** As an organizer, you are directly responsible for the success of at least one essential part of Purdue Hackers, and you commit to being there when you're needed. Other than this, organizers are no different than community members.

This means the best organizers are usually active community members, so we highly encourage you to [hang out in our Discord](https://puhack.horse/discord) and come to [an upcoming event](https://events.purduehackers.com) to get a feel for Purdue Hackers.

If you have any questions about anything in this README, please email mstanciu[at]purdue.edu or ask in `#lounge` in our Discord. Hope to see you around ðŸ’›
