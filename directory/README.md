# Read this before applying

Purdue Hackers is a group of students who help each other build creative technical projects. We're looking for a few new organizers to join our team. Thanks for checking out our little app! :D

Please read this before applying for any of the positions.

## What is Purdue Hackers?

Making creative technical projects is highly rewardingâ€”but academic and social obligations make it hard to find the time & motivation to do it regularly. Purdue Hackers aims to help others find their people and set aside time to make things together regularly.

Purdue Hackers is made up of 3 core programs:

- **Hack Night**: Our flagship program. A mini-hackathon every Friday night at the Bechtel Center.
- **Workshops**: Hour-long sessions that teach something new; attendees leave with a finished project.
- **Community**: A vibrant, friendly Discord community where people hang out & ship projects. We also announce all our events on there.

Purdue Hackers feels like stepping into a magical, colorful universe, a strange & surreal simulation of the real world. Community members have made a flag and [an alternative time system](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time), and are working on physical passports for the "citizens" of Purdue Hackers.

Internally, Purdue Hackers operates similarly to a startup: we have projects with directly responsible individuals, deliverables, & deadlines. We view our work as "shipping" to customers.

## Organizers vs. community members

Purdue Hackers is highly community-driven; many community members who are not organizers have run workshops, helped organize Hack Night, and helped others in the community. Our table at the Fall 2023 B-Involved fair was manned by two commmunity members. So, if community members are so willing to contribute to Purdue Hackers, why are we recruiting organizers?

Community members never commit to doing work; everything they do is done entirely out of personal excitement and/or the goodness of their hearts. But you can't run an organization entirely on the fuel of community member excitement. At some point, somebody needs to be responsible for the success of workshops; someone needs to design marketing material for an upcoming event; someone needs to maintain our software infrastructure; someone needs to secure funding.

**This is why we have organizers.** As an organizer, you are directly responsible for the success of at least one essential part of Purdue Hackers.

That said, the best organizers are also community members, so we highly encourage you to [hang out in our Discord](https://puhack.horse/discord) and come to [an upcoming event](https://events.purduehackers.com) to get a feel for Purdue Hackers.

If you have any questions about anything in this README, please email mstanciu[at]purdue.edu or ask in `#lounge` in our Discord. Hope to see you around ðŸ’›
