Design marketing materials & badges, and help build our brand identity.

# About Purdue Hackers

Making creative technical projects is highly rewarding‚Äîbut academic and social obligations make it hard to find the time & energy to do it regularly. Purdue Hackers aims to help others find their people and make things together regularly.

Please read the `README.md` for more information if you haven't already.

# About the role

Purdue Hackers has become very design-driven over the past two years. Via [our homepage](https://purduehackers.com), [socials](https://instagram.com/purduehackers), and [laser-cut collectibles](https://arc.net/l/quote/nhmllfoo), we‚Äôve crafted a bold & recognizable visual identity.

This year, we want to ramp up our visual output‚Äîbut across making a new badge every week, shipping a new brand, and designing weekly badges, our current design team is already quite capacity-constrained. We‚Äôre looking for 3 new designers to help them out.

## What you will do

- Create marketing materials for upcoming events, such as workshops, to be shared with professors & posted to our social media
- Work with the Hack Night Badges project owner & be responsible for the badge for some weeks
- Help create a new brand and integrate it into a new website & all our visual comms
- End-to-end ideate, design, and roll out a brand for an event we‚Äôre running at the end of the semester

While your main focus will be design work, you are encouraged to wear many hats & contribute to any other part of Purdue Hackers if you feel inspired to do so.

## About you

You will be a great fit for this role if you:

- Are extraordinarly kind, humble, creative, and curious
- Deeply resonate with Purdue Hackers & feel inspired to make it better
- Are a talented designer with an established portfolio

Bonus points if you:

- Have done brand design work in the past and/or are interested in high-level thinking about Purdue Hackers' brand
- Have good executive function and can work without much direction
- Are weird and/or have felt in the past like you struggled to find your people

## Time commitment

Some organizers spend 5-10 hours per week; others spend 20-30 hours per week. Some weeks will be heavier than others, but you can probably send somewhere in the 5-10 hour range and be successful. We're all full-time students, though, & are happy to be flexible.

# How to apply

Send an email to purduehackers@gmail.com including **"designer fall 2024‚Äù** (case-insensitive) in the subject line with the following:

- Tell us about yourself. Who are you, what are you studying, what are some of your hobbies, any other relevant things?
- What resonates with you about Purdue Hackers?
- What resonates with you about this role?
- If you have a portfolio of past work, please share it.
- Between badges, marketing materials, and brand designing, which excite(s) you the most?
	- This won‚Äôt affect your application, just curious what people gravitate more toward
- Anything else you find relevant

The structure of the email is up to you, but please "be real"‚Äîwe're students reading these too, and we're strongly anti-bullshit. Be authentically yourself!

## Next steps

We will reply to confirm we've received it; after that, you will only hear from us if we're interested in following up. There's no deadline on either end, and it's possible this position won't be filled for a while.

If we're interested in following up, we'll reach out to schedule a 20-minute Zoom call to get to know each other better.

After the call, you will receive a response‚Äîacceptance or rejection‚Äîwithin a week.
