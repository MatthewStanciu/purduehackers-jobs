# About Purdue Hackers

Making creative technical projects is highly rewardingâ€”but academic and social obligations make it hard to find the time & energy to do it regularly. Purdue Hackers aims to help others find their people and make things together regularly.

Please read the `README.md` for more information if you haven't already.

# About the role

Purdue Hackers has become increasingly design-driven over the last year. [Our homepage](https://purduehackers.com), which we shipped December 2022, introduced a new brand which we've been incrementally adopting. Every week, we design an intricate badge which we laser cut & give to Hack Night attendees (the "Hack Night badges").

We have a well-established design team, but they're starting to become capacity-constrained. We're looking for a new member to join the team.

## What you will do

- Create marketing materials for upcoming events, such as workshops, to be shared with professors & posted to our social media
- Work with the Hack Night Badges project owner & be responsible for the badge for some weeks
- Help adopt our new brand into all our visual communication
- Help improve our brand & move it forward

While your main focus will be design work, you are encouraged to wear many hats & contribute to any other part of Purdue Hackers if you feel inspired to do so.

## About you

You will be a great fit for this role if you:

- Are extraordinarly kind, humble, creative, and curious
- Deeply resonate with Purdue Hackers & feel inspired to make it better
- Are a talented designer with an established portfolio

Bonus points if you:

- Have done brand design work in the past and/or are interested in high-level thinking about Purdue Hackers' brand

## Time commitment

Up to you. Some organizers spend 5-10 hours per week; others spend 20-30 hours per week. Since this is a more clearly-scoped role, you can probably spend on the lower end (5-10 hours) and still be successful.

We mostly care that _some_ progress is happening every week. We're all full-time students & are happy to be flexible.

# How to apply

Send an email to purduehackers@gmail.com including **"designer fall 2023"** (case-insensitive) in the subject line with the following:

- Tell us about yourself. Who are you, what are you studying, what are some of your hobbies, any other relevant things?
- What resonates with you about Purdue Hackers?
- Why do you want to join the organizing team vs. contribute as a community member?
- If you have a portfolio of past work, please share it.
- Have you made anything you're proud of lately? Tell us about it and/or share a link to it! (It's ok if not) (Can be superseded by the portfolio question)
- Anything else you find relevant

The structure of the email is up to you, but please "be real"â€”we're students reading these too, and we're strongly anti-bullshit. Be authentically yourself!

## Next steps

We will reply to confirm we've received it; after that, you will only hear from us if we're interested in following up. There's no deadline on either end, and it's possible this position won't be filled for a while.

If we're interested in following up, we'll reach out to schedule a 20-minute Zoom call to get to know each other better.

After the call, you will receive a responseâ€”acceptance or rejectionâ€”within a week.
