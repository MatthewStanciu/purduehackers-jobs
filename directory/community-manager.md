# About Purdue Hackers

Making creative technical projects is highly rewardingâ€”but academic and social obligations make it hard to find the time & energy to do it regularly. Purdue Hackers aims to help others find their people and make things together regularly.

Please read the `README.md` for more information if you haven't already.

# About the role

The Discord community has rapidly become the center of gravity for Purdue Hackers: we announce all our events on there, and people regularly hang out, ship projects, and ask for technical help.

Over the last year, our community rocketed from a few hundred members to 1500+ members, and almost no activity to 300 weekly messages & 60 weekly active members. Along with this, a strong community identity has also formed. Today, we are the third-largest server under the "Clubs" section of the Discord student hub, and the ninth-largest overall.

We are not prepared for this much rapid growth. New members don't know where to go when they join, & there are no funnels to meeting people & having a great experience. Our gender balance is terrible. We also don't have a code of conduct, and in the past we've caused confusion by making moderation decisions based on unwritten rules. We're lucky to not have had a major community incident, but it's only a matter of time if we don't change course.

Today, nobody is responsible for the success of the community, and no existing organizer is excited to take it on. So, we're recruiting someone to help us.

## What you will do

- You will be end-to-end responsible for the community. You will be the primary moderator & final decision-maker.
- Set the vibe & culture of the community.
- Regularly chat in the community, get to know others, & make new folks feel welcome.
- Facilitate asynchronous community events, such as coworking calls.
- Write a new code of conduct, publish it on our website, and surface it to community members.
- Help organically improve the gender balance of the community.
- Design a robust onboarding flow for new members that makes them feel welcome, helps them meet new people, and surfaces interesting ongoing conversations.

While your main focus will be the community, you are encouraged to wear many hats & contribute to any other part of Purdue Hackers if you feel inspired to do so.

## About you

You'll be a great fit for this role if you:

- Are extraordinarly kind, humble, creative, and curious
- Deeply resonate with Purdue Hackers & feel inspired to make it better
- Love meeting new people & faciliating connections
- Regularly use Discord & consider yourself "online"
- Have experience moderating communities

Bonus points if you:

- Are technical or willing to learn
- Are a natural leader & are willing to eventually lead a small team
- Have designed systems before
- Are weird and/or have felt in the past like you struggled to find your people

Many of these are just suggestions; please apply if you are interested even if you don't feel like you tick every box.

## Time commitment

Up to you. Some organizers spend 5-10 hours per week; others spend 20-30 hours per week. Since this is a higher-level role with many responsibilities, you may need to spend somewhere in the mid (10-20) to high (20-30) range of hours per week in order to be successful.

However, we're all full-time students & are happy to be flexible. We mostly care that _some_ progress is happening every week.

# How to apply

Send an email to purduehackers@gmail.com including **"community manager fall 2023"** (case-insensitive) in the subject line with the following:

- Tell us about yourself. Who are you, what are you studying, what are some of your hobbies, any other relevant things?
- What resonates with you about Purdue Hackers?
- What resonates with you about this role?
- Why do you want to join the organizing team vs. contribute as a community member?
- Have you made anything you're proud of lately? Tell us about it and/or share a link to it! (It's ok if not)
- Anything else you find relevant

The structure of the email is up to you, but please "be real"â€”we're students reading these too, and we're strongly anti-bullshit. Be authentically yourself!

## Next steps

We will reply to confirm we've received it; after that, you will only hear from us if we're interested in following up. There's no deadline on either end, and it's possible this position won't be filled for a while.

If we're interested in following up, we'll reach out to schedule a 20-minute Zoom call to get to know each other better.

After the call, you will receive a responseâ€”acceptance or rejectionâ€”within a week.
