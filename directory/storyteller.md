Tell the story of Purdue Hackers to members, faculty, and sponsors.

# About Purdue Hackers

Making creative technical projects is highly rewardingâ€”but academic and social obligations make it hard to find the time & energy to do it regularly. Purdue Hackers aims to help others find their people and make things together regularly.

Please read the `README.md` for more information if you haven't already.

# About the role

Purdue Hackers has gone through many eras over our 11-year lifespan, and has been radically transformed over the last two years. Our community has explodedâ€”it's now the largest server under "Clubs" in the Purdue Discord student hub and the fourth-largest overall. Two years ago, the community had almost no activity; today, it has 2,000 weekly messages & 160 weekly active members, & a strong community identity.

Hack Night is a symbol of our transformation: every Friday, 80 people show up to the Bechtel Center and hack on cool projects togetherâ€”including an LED sign, Conway's Game of Life over SSH, [an alternative time system](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time), a camera on a motor that tracks objects, and many others.

A radical transformation of this kind doesn't happen on its own; it was the result of years of coordinated effort among community members & organizers to build the space we wish we had. Storytelling is a major piece of this puzzle.

Storytelling is how we communicate to the universe what Purdue Hackers is and does. Good storytelling inspires others & gets them excited to take actionâ€”for students, that's spending time in the community, regularly coming to events, spreading the word to their friends, and contributing to the Purdue Hackers project; for University-affiliated adults, it's supporting us via promotion & connections; for tech companies, it's supporting us financially. Successful storytelling brings the world into our corner, helping us grow in whatever way they can, creating a positive feedback loop of greatness.

Storytelling passes through everything we do. It begins with high-level vibe-setting & world-building. This turns into a brand, from which we extract a core message that we repeat over and over. This message appears in different forms across our website, marketing materials, and projects. [Our website](https://purduehackers.com) is storytelling. [Our blog](https://blog.purduehackers.com) is storytelling. Our callout is storytelling. The Hack Night badges are storytelling. The tone of our `#announcements` is storytelling. This app is storytelling.

Nearly all of our storytelling thus far has been the work of one person. We're looking for a new organizer to help expand our storytelling efforts.

## What you will do

- Write a monthly "VIP newsletter" that we send to current & prospective sponsors, Purdue faculty, and alumni, showing what Purdue Hackers has been working on
- Draft announcements for upcoming events to be posted on Discord and Instagram
- Solicit [blog posts](https://blog.purduehackers.com) from community members about their projects, aiming to publish one post per month
- Send emails to professors, groups, and students to promote upcoming events

This is a PR role, but different from what you may have seen before: while many student orgs stop their PR efforts at event promotion, Purdue Hackers also writes articles and newsletters to keep in touch with important people and document our work for future generations. As such, this role primarily consists of _lots_ of writing.

You will own some very important projectsâ€”our blog posts and VIP newsletters have directly led to fundraising & mass awareness of Purdue Hackersâ€”but you will not be alone. Other team members already do public comms work and email professors; you will add extra capacity to these efforts and bring them together under one owner.

## About you

You will be a great fit for this role if you:

- Are radically kind, creative, wholesome, and curious
- Deeply resonate with Purdue Hackers & feel inspired to make it better
- Are an excellent writer & want to spend lots of time writing
- Have some experience with professional writing or public comms

Bonus points if you:

- Are technical or willing to learn
- Are a natural leader & are willing to eventually lead a small team
- Are weird and/or have felt in the past like you struggled to find your people

Many of these are just suggestions; please apply if you are interested even if you don't feel like you tick every box.

## Time commitment

Some organizers spend 5-10 hours per week; others spend 20-30 hours per week. Some weeks will be heavier than others, but you can probably send somewhere in the 5-10 hour range and be successful. We're all full-time students, though, & are happy to be flexible.

# How to apply

Send an email to purduehackers@gmail.com including **"storyteller fall 2024"** (not case-sensitive) in the subject line with the following:

- Tell us about yourself. Who are you, what are you studying, what are some of your hobbies, any other relevant things?
- What resonates with you about Purdue Hackers?
- What resonates with you about this role?
- If you've done professional writing or public comms, please share a link, screenshot, or sample of some of your past work. (It's ok if you haven't)
- Anything else you find relevant.

The structure of the email is up to you, but please "be real"â€”we're students reading these too, and we're strongly anti-bullshit. Be authentically yourself!

## Next steps

We will reply to confirm we've received it; after that, you will only hear from us if we're interested in following up. There's no deadline on either end, and it's possible this position won't be filled for a while.

If we're interested in following up, we'll reach out to schedule a 20-minute Zoom call to get to know each other better.

After the call, you will receive a final follow-up within a week.
