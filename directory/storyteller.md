Tell the story of Purdue Hackers to members, faculty, and sponsors.

# About Purdue Hackers

Making creative technical projects is highly rewardingâ€”but academic and social obligations make it hard to find the time & energy to do it regularly. Purdue Hackers aims to help others find their people and make things together regularly.

Please read the `README.md` for more information if you haven't already.

# About the role

Purdue Hackers has gone through many eras over our 10-year lifespan; more recently, it has been radically transformed over the last year. Our community has explodedâ€”it's now the third-largest server under "Clubs" in the Discord student hub and the ninth-lagest overall. A year ago, the community had almost no activity; today, it has 300 weekly messages & 60 weekly active members, & a strong community identity.

Hack Night is a symbol of our transformation: every Friday, 30 people show up to the Bechtel Center and hack on cool projects togetherâ€”including an LED sign, Conway's Game of Life over SSH, [an alternative time system](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/lightning-time), a camera on a motor that tracks objects, and many others.

A radical transformation of this kind doesn't happen on its own; it was the result of a year of coordinated effort among community members & organizers to build the space we wish we had. Storytelling is a major piece of this puzzle.

Storytelling is how we communicate to the universe what Purdue Hackers is and does. Good storytelling inspires others & gets them excited to take actionâ€”for students, that's spending time in the community, regularly coming to events, spreading the word to their friends, and contributing to the Purdue Hackers project; for University-affiliated adults, it's supporting us via promotion & connections; for tech companies, it's supporting us financially. Successful storytelling brings the world into our corner, helping us grow in whatever way they can, creating a positive feedback loop of greatness.

Storytelling passes through everything we do. It begins with high-level vibe-setting & world-building. This turns into a brand, from which we extract a core message that we repeat over and over. This message appears in different forms across our website, marketing materials, and projects. [Our website](https://purduehackers.com) is storytelling. [Our blog](https://blog.purduehackers.com) is storytelling. Our callout is storytelling. The Hack Night badges are storytelling. The tone of our `#announcements` is storytelling. This app is storytelling.

All of our storytelling thus far has been the work of one person. We're looking for a new organizer to help expand our storytelling efforts.

## What you will do

- Work closely with the President to craft the vision & world of Purdue Hackers
- Draft announcements for upcoming events
- Help draft the content of our social media posts to be consistent with our brand
- Design & coordinate creative marketing campaigns
- Send emails to professors, groups, and students to promote upcoming events
- Communicate with industry partners & potential sponsors
- Coordinate with designers to make sure we have delightful visual communication
- If technical, build projects like this app to get people excited about Purdue Hackers

This role is a mix of high-level thinking & coordination and low-level marketing tasks. While this will be your main focus, you are encouraged to wear many hats & contribute to any other part of Purdue Hackers if you feel inspired to do so.

## About you

You will be a great fit for this role if you:

- Are radically kind, creative, wholesome, and curious
- Deeply resonate with Purdue Hackers & feel inspired to make it better
- Daydream & imagine often
- Are an excellent writer
- Have previous experience managing social media for an organization

Bonus points if you:

- Are technical or willing to learn
- Are a natural leader & are willing to eventually lead a small team
- Have designed systems before
- Are weird and/or have felt in the past like you struggled to find your people

Many of these are just suggestions; please apply if you are interested even if you don't feel like you tick every box.

## Time commitment

Up to you. Some organizers spend 5-10 hours per week; others spend 20-30 hours per week. Since this is a higher-level role with many responsibilities, you may need to spend somewhere in the mid (10-20) to high (20-30) range of hours per week in order to be successful.

However, we're all full-time students & are happy to be flexible. We mostly care that _some_ progress is happening every week.

# How to apply

Send an email to purduehackers@gmail.com including **"storyteller fall 2023"** (case-insensitive) in the subject line with the following:

- Tell us about yourself. Who are you, what are you studying, what are some of your hobbies, any other relevant things?
- What resonates with you about Purdue Hackers?
- What resonates with you about this role?
- Why do you want to join the organizing team vs. contribute as a community member?
- Have you made anything you're proud of lately? Tell us about it and/or share a link to it! (It's ok if not)
- Anything else you find relevant

The structure of the email is up to you, but please "be real"â€”we're students reading these too, and we're strongly anti-bullshit. Be authentically yourself!

## Next steps

We will reply to confirm we've received it; after that, you will only hear from us if we're interested in following up. There's no deadline on either end, and it's possible this position won't be filled for a while.

If we're interested in following up, we'll reach out to schedule a 20-minute Zoom call to get to know each other better.

After the call, you will receive a responseâ€”acceptance or rejectionâ€”within a week.
