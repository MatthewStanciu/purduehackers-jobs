Run the best social media account on campus.

# About Purdue Hackers

Making creative technical projects is highly rewardingâ€”but academic and social obligations make it hard to find the time & energy to do it regularly. Purdue Hackers aims to help others find their people and make things together regularly.

Please read the `README.md` for more information if you haven't already.

# About the role

Purdue Hackers has been radically transformed over the past year. Part of this transformation has been an entirely new brand, featuring bright colors, sharp corners, a wacky tone in event announcements, and silly hand-drawn creatures ("la creatura"). You can see this brand in action on [our homepage](https://purduehackers.com) and the last few posts on [our Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/purduehackers/).

Our wacky & brightly-colored brand is instantly recognizable to everyone within Purdue Hackers, but not to nearly anyone outside of Purdue Hackers. Part of the reason for this is that nobody is in charge of running our social media, so it's not very effective at getting people excited about Purdue Hackers. On Instagram, we only post when we have a workshop to promote, our posts only gain 30-60 likes, and we have less than half the number of followers as the number of members in our community. We can be doing so much better. This year, we want to get in front of as many people on campus as we can and grab their attention.

We're looking for someone to end-to-end own our social mediaâ€”primarily Instagram, which we use to market to students.

## What you will do

- Post marketing materials for upcoming events on Instagram
- Make at least one Instagram post per week, in addition to any event marketing, of your choiceâ€”featuring a recent workshop, Hack Night, or creatura
- Regularly feature student projects on Instagram in the form of Reels
- Interact with DMs and comments on Instagram
- Post related or semi-related contentâ€”including takeovers, wacky brain dumps, event reminders, and featured projects on Instagram stories every few days
- Grow our Instagram account to 2,000 followers by the end of the year

This role is similar to other student org social media roles, but different in a few key ways: the "social media person" at many student orgs typically posts only what is given to them by leadership, e.g. event marketing materialsâ€”but here, you will also serve as a creative director. You will regularly come up with your own posts, craft the message, and post them without input from others on the team. You will be steering the ship.

## About you

You will be a great fit for this role if you:

- Are radically kind, creative, wholesome, and curious
- Deeply resonate with Purdue Hackers & feel inspired to make it better
- Have managed social media for other orgs
- Are willing to spend a not-insignificant chunk of your week thinking about Purdue Hackers' social media
- Have ADHD and/or regular deranged intrusive thoughts

Bonus points if you:

- Are technical or willing to learn
- Are a natural leader & are willing to eventually lead a small team
- Are weird and/or have felt in the past like you struggled to find your people

Many of these are just suggestions; please apply if you are interested even if you don't feel like you tick every box.

## Time commitment

Some organizers spend 5-10 hours per week; others spend 20-30 hours per week. Some weeks will be heavier than others, but you can probably send somewhere in the 5-10 hour range and be successful. We're all full-time students, though, & are happy to be flexible.

# How to apply

Send an email to purduehackers@gmail.com including **"head of social spring 2024"** (not case-sensitive) in the subject line with the following:

- Tell us about yourself. Who are you, what are you studying, what are some of your hobbies, any other relevant things?
- What resonates with you about Purdue Hackers?
- What resonates with you about this role?
- If you've managed a social media account before, please share the account or a screenshot of some of your work.
- Anything else you find relevant.

The structure of the email is up to you, but please "be real"â€”we're students reading these too, and we're strongly anti-bullshit. Be authentically yourself!

## Next steps

We will reply to confirm we've received it; after that, you will only hear from us if we're interested in following up. There's no deadline on either end, and it's possible this position won't be filled for a while.

If we're interested in following up, we'll reach out to schedule a 20-minute Zoom call to get to know each other better.

After the call, you will receive a final follow-up within a week.
