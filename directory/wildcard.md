# About Purdue Hackers

Making creative technical projects is highly rewardingâ€”but academic and social obligations make it hard to find the time & energy to do it regularly. Purdue Hackers aims to help others find their people and make things together regularly.

Please read the `README.md` for more information if you haven't already.

# Wildcard

For the Fall 2024 semester, Purdue Hackers is looking for a Bread Getter, Head of Social, and Storyteller. We're looking for these positions because we urgently need these sets of skills on our team, but everyone on our team either doesn't have these skills or is swamped with their existing work.

We're extremely cautious with adding a new member to the team. As of writing in August 2024, Purdue Hackers has 14 organizersâ€”that's a very large team, whose schedules for our weekly All Hands become more difficult to coordinate & who become more difficult to manage the larger the team becomes. Larger teams also run the risk of lowering everyone's ambitions, because they make folks feel like there's always someone else to do something, discourage them from working outside their specific domain, and make it harder for the spotlight to be on everyone doing their best work.

We typically don't recruit for roles other than what we're specifically looking for because we want to be very cautious of team size and we want every new team member to start with a clearly-defined role that fills an immediate need.

That said, we've previously recruited team members who didn't fit any of the roles we had open, and they've all been wonderful additions. So, if you've read all the previous roles and found that none resonate with you, we want to leave the door open for you too.

Please be aware that this is a risky position to apply for. We will prioritize the other positions and active community members over this role, which may never be filled. Before continuing, please give `bread-getter.md`, `head-of-social.md`, and `storyteller.md` another read and make sure you really feel none of them are a good fit for you.

# How to apply

Send an email to purduehackers@gmail.com including **"wildcard fall 2024"** (not case-sensitive) in the subject line with the following:

- Tell us about yourself. Who are you, what are you studying, what are some of your hobbies, any other relevant things?
- What resonates with you about Purdue Hackers?
- What do you envision working on as a Purdue Hackers organizer? Please pitch a specific role with actionable goals.
- What resonates with you about this vs. the other open positions?
- Much of our best work is done by community members who are not organizers. What draws you to being an organizer vs. working on your vision as a community member?
- Anything else you find relevant.

The structure of the email is up to you, but please "be real"â€”we're students reading these too, and we're strongly anti-bullshit. Be authentically yourself!

## Next steps

We will reply to confirm we've received it; after that, you will only hear from us if we're interested in following up. There's no deadline on either end, and it's possible this position won't be filled for a while (if ever).

If we're interested in following up, we'll reach out to schedule a 20-minute Zoom call to get to know each other better.

After the call, you will receive a final follow-up within a week.
